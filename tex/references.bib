Its use has spread far beyond its original application (aviation), focus (crew complement), and language (English). This survey of 550 studies in which NASA-TLX was used or reviewed was undertaken to provide a resource for a new generation of users. The goal was to summarize the environments in which it has been applied, the types of activities the raters performed, other variables that were measured that did (or did not) covary, methodological issues, and lessons learned},

	abstract = {Mechanical Entanglement is a musical composition for three performers. Three force feedback devices each containing two haptic faders are mutually coupled using virtual linear springs and dampers. During the composition, the performers feel each others’ gestures and collaboratively process the music material. The interaction’s physical modelling parameters are modified during the different sections of the composition. An algorithm which processthree stereo channels, is stretching in and out-of-sync three copies of the same music. The performers are controlling the stretching algorithm and an amplitude modulation effect, both applied to recognisable classical and contemporary music recordings. Each of them is substantially modifying the length and the dynamics of the music and issimultaneously affecting subtly or abruptly the gestural behaviour of the other performers. At fixed points during the composition, the music becomes gradually in sync and the performers realign their gestures. This phasing game between gestures and sound, creates tension and emphasises the physicality of the performance.},

	abstract = {A piano key prototype actuated by a custom-made linear actuator is proposed to enhance the touch of digital pianos by reproducing the force feedback of an acoustic piano action. This paper presents the design and the validation of the haptic device. The approach exploits a multibody model to compute the action dynamics and the corresponding force on the key in real time. More specifically, a grand piano model that includes the five action bodies, its geometry and the specific force laws, is computed in the haptic device. A presizing step along with Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis produced an especially made actuator satisfying the design requirements, in particular the highly dynamic nature of the force to be transmitted. Force peaks, up to 50 (N) in less than 20 (ms), are reachable with low power consumption. Compared to previous solutions: (i) the key physical characteristics are preserved; (ii) the feedback is based on a real-time multibody model that is easily configurable and interchangeable; (iii) an experimental validation of the actuator within the prototype is developed and demonstrates its feasibility. The results confirm that the voice coil can produce suitable haptic feedback. In particular, rendering a grand piano action within the device shows promising haptic force profiles.},
